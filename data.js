CSS allows web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its structure, making it easier to create and maintain consistent and visually appealing websites. CSS is used to define the font styles, colors, layout, spacing, and other visual elements of a web page, and can be applied to individual elements or across entire pages. CSS works by using selectors to target specific HTML elements and then applying styles and properties to those elements. By separating the presentation from the structure, CSS allows web developers to create flexible and dynamic web pages that can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.",
